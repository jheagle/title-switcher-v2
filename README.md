title-switcher-v2.0.0
==============

This is the updated title-switcher which takes a more object-oriented
approach and improves many deficiencies of the original title-switcher.

Add typing effect to titles and also switch through several titles.

This project can be used as a plugin with limited set-up requirements.
No need to change the code in the title-switcher.js file except for
customization.

Add the titles to the DOM beside each other as heading tags or divs within
a div and give one of the titles the class "displayTitle". The other sample
code such as style can be used to improve how it displays.

Include the the jquery library before including this plugin.
NOTE: No longer requires jQuery Migrate.

If there are any problems contact me, but set-up should be done based on
the sample code for best results.
